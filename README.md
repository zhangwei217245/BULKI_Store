## Compile on Perlmutter

Make sure you have protobuf installed, and you have to set the following environment variables:

```bash
export PROTOC=/path/to/protoc
```

If you don't have rust, please follow this instruction to install rust first:

https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install


```bash
module load PrgEnv-llvm/1.0
export CC=$(which clang)
CLANG_DIR=$(dirname "$CC")
export LIBCLANG_PATH="$CLANG_DIR/../lib"
```

Finally, you can compile the project by running:

```bash
cargo build --(debug|release)
```
